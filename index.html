                    <p>Orange County is a stronghold of growth, empowerment and progress.</p>

                    <p>Our core values represent the best in Orange County and America as a whole. However, we live in times where our political representation is focused more on their own beliefs, their party and personal political power. This pretentious “representation” dishonors the fierce, American independence alive in our citizens. It’s time to hold our politicians accountable to The People: the tax-paying citizens they work for.</p>

                    <p>We are patriotic Americans that believe in the traditional American values of Individualism, Liberty and Equality. We are dreamers of the American Dream. We think these things are accomplished by hard work, and self-determination which is why we want to put in the hard work to make sure our elected leaders are doing the work that we want them too.</p>
